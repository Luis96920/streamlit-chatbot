This streamlit is just an example of how a Large Language Model works. This streamlit is built upon FALCON-4B llm. This llm is light weight and does not require a GPU. 
This example are taken from langchain library. The link to the original [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent/tree/main). But that chatbot requires you to have OPEN_AI API Key. You don't need that here. Link to the chatbot [site](https://chat-lang.streamlit.app/)
